# COS30018 Intelligent Systems - Automatic Car License Detection and Recognition

## Automatic Malaysia Car License Plate Detection and Recognition
Project: Design and implementation of a simple machine learning system for AI-powered smart on-road surveillance system. Students will apply computer vision techniques to solve two major challenges: detecting Malaysia car license plates on the road and recognizing characters and numbers on license plates.
Modules involved: Machine learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision

### Summary
License plate detection and recognition technology has a wide range of applications across various industries.
For instance, in toll collection, automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) is used on highways to identify
vehicles passing through toll booths, streamlining the tolling process and reducing traffic congestion. At
border control and customs, ALPR systems help monitor vehicles crossing international borders, enhancing
security and preventing illegal activity. In fleet management, businesses with large vehicle fleets, such as
delivery services, use license plate detection to track vehicle locations, optimize routes, and improve
operational efficiency. This project focuses on applying computer vision techniques to detect and recognize
Malaysian car license plates in real-time, laying the groundwork for an AI-powered smart on-road
surveillance system capable of analyzing and tracking vehicles using mobile devices or dashcams. This
technology plays a critical role in automated law enforcement by helping to track stolen vehicles or identify
suspicious vehicles.
